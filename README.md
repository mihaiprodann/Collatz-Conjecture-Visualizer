# Collatz Conjecture info

The Collatz Conjecture is a mathematical problem that proposes a simple process that is applied to any positive integer, regardless of its value. The conjecture states that if we start with any positive integer and repeat the following process, we will eventually reach the number 1: if the number is even, divide it by 2, and if the number is odd, multiply it by 3 and add 1. The conjecture was first proposed by German mathematician Lothar Collatz in 1937. Despite much effort by mathematicians, a proof or counterexample has yet to be found, making it one of the most famous unsolved problems in mathematics.

The formula for the Collatz Conjecture can be written as:
<kbd>
if n is even: n = n/2
else: n = 3n + 1
